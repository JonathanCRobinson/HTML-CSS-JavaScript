            <h1>The Land Sentinel</h1>
            <p>The Land Sentinel is known to shape the earth and land with its strength and some have even seen it use a form of
                telekinesis. Often times new rivers, caves, and sometimes mountain form where ever these beings have been.
                Researchers are still unsure why they change and manipulate the environment around them but some speculate it is done 
                out of boredom or if it's to help other organisms access more of the land. 
                Locals refer to the creatures as Golems, Giants, and Titans. Most can be found in the mountains, plains, canyons, and even in some hillsides.
                But be weary as a lot of them tend to bury themselves in the ground while resting and can resemble boulders or sometimes small rocks depending
                on how deep they go. 
	        </p>
            <p>Each sentinel has a different personality and will sometimes hoard small objects, relative to how ever large they are, to 
            keep them company while there is nothing to do. Most folks who have encountered them have often compared them to a cat’s soul being trapped in 
            a gorilla's body. An elaboration of that is they can vary widely between playful, lazy, aggressive, and curious depending on which one you can 
            find. Sentinels tend to want to be left alone though but if they are curious enough and venture to close to humans it is best to stay still, remain 
            calm, and try not upset it. If it becomes enraged, run as far and quickly as possibly since these beings can manipulate physical objects to it’s whim.
            </p>
