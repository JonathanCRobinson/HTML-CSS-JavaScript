            <h1>The Oceanic Leviathan</h1>
            <p>Many sailors fear the open ocean due to this colossal  beast patrolling the deeper parts of the sea. It has been rumored
                to thrive in trenches and colder areas while hunting at the surface to catch whales and fisherman's bounties. Some even
                worship these creatures portraying them as Gods of the sea and will often make shrines on coastlines and cliff sides to 
                pray for safe travels across the ocean. Only a handful of sailors have seen them and say some can be as large as cargo ships, 
                which can be the length of 900 to 1,200 feet. Our marine biologist Anthony Timdrake has stated that:
            </p>
            <blockquote>"Many of the locals say that the ocean is quite safe so long as no one sails at night or during dark storms. 
                With the context of that, I assume the leviathan only comes to the surface of the water at night or when it seems dark out.
                I'm not sure why that's the case but until we can build a safe ship to handle an attack, we will not endanger anyone
                to verify that information."
            </blockquote>
            <p> Appearances of the creature can vary depending on the location and environment of its habitat. Some can be brightly colored to 
            mimic the coral reefs off of islands, dark and jagged to blend in with caves and old rusted structures, and the most common ones tend to have a 
            dark grey or blue black with a light underbelly resembling great whites or humpback whales. The camouflage Leviathans have developed keep them secret 
            from most dives and explorations but with our technology advancing with thermal and sonar imaging we should be able to document more variety and 
            possibly even sub species that may lurk in even deeper depths that haven't been seen yet.
